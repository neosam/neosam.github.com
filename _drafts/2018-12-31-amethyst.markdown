I love Rust!  It is fast, flexible and the compiler is always telling me what
I'm doing wrong.  Once my code compiles, it actually works (mostly).

Recently, I stubled over the Amethyst engine.  It's an ECS engine which is written
completely in Rust.

# What is ECS?
It means Entity Component System.  You basically have a World where you can add
Entities.  To the Entities, you can assign Components which could be a screen position,
a bounding rect, an image to draw, etc.  Finally Systems will iterate over all
entities which have specific components assigned and can modify them.

For example, one could build a MoveSystem which iterates over all Entities which have
a SpeedComponent and a ScreenPositionComponent assigned and modify the
ScreenPositionComponent based on the SpeedComponent.

With this, all data (= Component) is encapsulated from the the logic (= System).
And the ability to add several Systems to the engine allows to only take care of one
specific task in each system.  For example, there can be single systems for user input,
movement, sword attack, animations, audio, etc.
