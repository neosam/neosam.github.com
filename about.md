# About neosam
I'm a software developer living in Munich. Like many other developers in my generation,
I started with QBasic as a child and continued learning Delphi and finally C and C++.
During my time as a student I started to code in Java.  In my own time I prefer more
interesting languages like Rust or Haskell.
