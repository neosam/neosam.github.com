Since I'm not sure about the privacy concerns of GDPR with the dat protocol,
I'm moving to github pages.  With dat, I see a pricacy issue since it's decentralized.
If someone want's to see who connects to this blog, the attacker simply can host
the page as well and log the IPs.  This means, I cannot control who logs the visitors of
my blog.  Unfortunately, I didn't find anything regarding datproject and GDPR anywhere in
the web.

On Github Pages, I only need to deal with Github and they claim to not store anything.

Please don't get me wrong.  I would love to use datproject and beaker browser but I'm really
not sure if it's easy to observe.
